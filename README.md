Parsing File Metadata with FileReader
==

This demo uses the [ExifReader](https://github.com/mattiasw/ExifReader/tree/iptc) JS library by @mattiasw who has done a tremendous job of figuring out how to read embedded data through the FileReader API. Please note that the ExifReader.js file used in this demo was taken from the `iptc` branch, and will not work with the released version.

To get started simply choose a file and hit the upload button. Nothing is posted; instead the file is processed in the browser and the extracted metadata will appear below the form.
